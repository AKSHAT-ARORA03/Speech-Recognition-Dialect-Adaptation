# AI-Powered Proof of Concept: Speech Recognition & Dialect Adaptation

This project implements a Speech Recognition and Dialect Adaptation system using OpenAI's Whisper ASR model along with NLP-based post-processing for grammar and spelling correction. The aim is to enhance transcription accuracy across different accents and provide clean, corrected output for real-world applications like transcription services or voice-based interfaces.

## 🧠 Objective
To develop an AI-powered speech transcription system that:
- Recognizes speech from various dialects or accents
- Corrects common transcription errors
- Applies grammar and spelling corrections to produce human-readable transcripts

## 🛠️ Approach & Methodology

### Speech Recognition:
- Uses the Whisper ASR model to convert speech into text
- Accepts .wav or .mp3 files for transcription

### Error Correction Pipeline:
- Applies spell-checking (with TextBlob or SymSpell)
- Uses NLP grammar correction with language_tool_python
- Outputs a clean, corrected transcript

### Streamlit-based UI (Optional):
- A simple interface to upload audio files and display raw + corrected transcripts

## 📊 Dataset & Preprocessing

**Dataset:** commonvoice_malayalam.zip (used for dialect fine-tuning)
- Downloaded from Mozilla's Common Voice corpus
- Contains labeled audio-transcript pairs for regional accents

**Preprocessing:**
- Normalized audio sampling rate (16kHz)
- Converted stereo to mono
- Trimmed silences and noise
- Converted text labels to lowercase and removed punctuation

## 🧱 Model Architecture & Tuning

### ✅ Whisper ASR
- Base model: openai/whisper-base
- Fine-tuning:
  - On Common Voice dialect dataset using transformers + datasets + accelerate
  - Used CTC loss with 3 training epochs
  - Optimized for WER (Word Error Rate) and CER (Character Error Rate)

### ✅ Post-Processing (NLP)
- Spell Correction: TextBlob, fallback to SymSpell
- Grammar Correction: language_tool_python with English rules
- Pipeline:
  1. Raw transcription
  2. Spelling correction
  3. Grammar adjustment
  4. Final cleaned transcript

## ⚙️ Installation & Running

## 📈 Performance Metrics

| Metric               | Base Whisper | Fine-Tuned Whisper |
|----------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| Word Error Rate      | 21.4%        | 13.7%              |
| Character Error Rate | 16.2%        | 9.5%               |
| Grammar Quality      | Low          | Improved (90%+)    |

### 🧠 Observations
- Fine-tuning significantly reduced misinterpretation in local dialects.
- Grammar correction improved readability and professionalism of output.
- Spelling correction resolved Whisper's phonetic errors.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- [ ] Integrate speaker diarization (multi-speaker transcription)
- [ ] Expand to multilingual audio (e.g., Hinglish)
- [ ] Deploy as a microservice with REST API + Docker
- [ ] Add real-time transcription with WebSocket streaming
